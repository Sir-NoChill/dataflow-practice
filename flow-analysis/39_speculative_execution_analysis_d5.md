# Speculative Execution Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze opportunities for speculative execution and code hoisting with safety considerations.

## Three-Address Code
```
B1: p = input_pointer
    flag = input_flag
    if p != null goto B2
    goto B8
B2: if flag goto B3
    goto B5
B3: expensive_computation = complex_calc(p->data)  // may be speculated
    if expensive_computation > threshold goto B4
    goto B5
B4: result = expensive_computation * 2
    goto B6
B5: result = default_value
    goto B6
B6: if additional_condition goto B7
    goto B8
B7: result = result + bonus_calc(p->other_field)   // speculation candidate
    goto B8
B8: return result
```

## Tasks
1. Identify speculation candidates and their safety requirements
2. Analyze control dependence for speculation opportunities
3. Evaluate exception safety and side effect constraints
4. Estimate speculation profitability considering misprediction costs
5. Design compensation code for incorrect speculation

## Expected Output Format
- Speculation candidate identification with safety analysis
- Control dependence and exception safety evaluation
- Profitability analysis with branch prediction modeling
- Speculative code transformation with compensation code
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
