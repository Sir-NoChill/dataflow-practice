# Machine Learning Guided Analysis

## Problem Statement
Use machine learning to guide flow analysis decisions and optimization heuristics.

## Three-Address Code with Feature Extraction
```
function ml_optimization_target():
B1: // Features: loop depth=2, basic blocks=8, branches=3
    outer_bound = input_size
    inner_factor = complexity_param
    accumulator = 0

B2: for i = 0 to outer_bound     // Loop characteristics
B3:   computation_cost = estimate_cost(i, inner_factor)
      if computation_cost > threshold goto B4
      goto B6

B4:   for j = 0 to inner_factor  // Nested loop pattern
B5:     temp = heavy_computation(i, j)  // Expensive operation
        accumulator += temp
      end for
      goto B7

B6:   temp = light_computation(i)       // Cheap alternative
      accumulator += temp
      goto B7

B7: end for
    return accumulator
```

## Available Training Data
- Historical optimization decisions and their performance outcomes
- Code features: loop nesting, branch patterns, memory access patterns
- Performance metrics: execution time, cache misses, energy consumption

## Tasks
1. Extract relevant features for ML-guided optimization
2. Design ML models to predict optimization profitability
3. Use ML predictions to guide analysis precision/cost trade-offs
4. Validate ML-guided decisions against traditional heuristics
5. Analyze the interpretability and reliability of ML guidance

## Expected Output Format
- Feature extraction from code structure and analysis results
- ML model design for optimization decision making
- Comparison of ML-guided vs traditional heuristic approaches
- Interpretability analysis of ML decisions
- Reliability and robustness assessment
