# Vectorization Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze loop structures for SIMD vectorization opportunities.

## Three-Address Code
```
function vector_process(A[], B[], C[], n):
B1: for i = 0 to n-4 step 4
B2:   // Potential vector operations
      A[i] = B[i] + C[i]
      A[i+1] = B[i+1] + C[i+1]
      A[i+2] = B[i+2] + C[i+2]
      A[i+3] = B[i+3] + C[i+3]

      // Dependent computation
      D[i] = A[i] * 2

      // Conditional vectorization challenge
      if B[i] > threshold goto B3
      goto B4
B3:   E[i] = sqrt(A[i])
      goto B4
B4: end for

B5: // Cleanup loop for remaining elements
    for j = i to n-1
B6:   A[j] = B[j] + C[j]
      D[j] = A[j] * 2
    end for
    return
```
