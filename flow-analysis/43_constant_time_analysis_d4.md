# Constant-Time Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze code for constant-time execution properties to prevent timing-based side-channel attacks.

## Three-Address Code
```
function secure_compare(secret[], input[], length):
B1: result = 0
    for i = 0 to length-1
B2:   // Potential timing leak
      if secret[i] != input[i] goto B3
      goto B4
B3:   result = 1              // Early termination leak
      goto B5                 // Branch timing leak
B4:   // Continue comparison
B5: end for

B6: // Another timing issue
    if result == 0 goto B7
    goto B8
B7: expensive_operation()     // Timing leak based on comparison result
    return SUCCESS
B8: cheap_operation()
    return FAILURE

function secure_select(condition, a, b):
B9:  // Constant-time selection
     mask = -(condition)      // 0 or 0xFFFFFFFF
     result = (mask & a) | ((~mask) & b)
     return result
```

## Tasks
1. Identify operations that may leak timing information
2. Analyze data-dependent control flow and memory access patterns
3. Detect potential side-channel vulnerabilities
4. Propose constant-time transformations
5. Verify timing independence of optimized code

## Expected Output Format
- Timing leak identification and classification
- Data dependency analysis for secret-dependent operations
- Side-channel vulnerability assessment
- Constant-time code transformation recommendations
- Verification of timing properties in optimized code
