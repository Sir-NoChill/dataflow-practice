# Region-Based Analysis

## Problem Statement
Perform region-based analysis on the following code with nested control structures.

## Three-Address Code
```
B1: x = input
    region_outer_begin
    goto B2
B2: if x > 100 goto B10
B3: region_inner1_begin
    y = x * 2
    for i = 0 to y
B4:   if i % 2 == 0 goto B5
      goto B6
B5:   temp = process_even(i)
      goto B7
B6:   temp = process_odd(i)
B7:   result[i] = temp
    end for
    region_inner1_end
    goto B8
B8: region_inner2_begin
    if y > 50 goto B9
    z = fast_path(y)
    goto B9
B9: z = slow_path(y)
    region_inner2_end
    x = x - 10
    goto B2
B10: region_outer_end
     return result
```

## Tasks
1. Identify natural regions and their hierarchical structure
2. Perform region-based dataflow analysis
3. Compute region summaries for interprocedural analysis
4. Analyze how region structure affects optimization
5. Compare region-based vs basic block-based analysis precision

## Expected Output Format
- Region hierarchy identification
- Region entry/exit analysis
- Region-based dataflow summaries
- Optimization opportunities unique to region-based analysis
- Precision and efficiency comparison with basic block analysis
