# Polyhedral Analysis

## Problem Statement
Apply polyhedral analysis to optimize nested loops with complex iteration spaces.

## Three-Address Code
```
// Complex nested loop with dependencies
for i = 1 to N-1
  for j = 1 to M-1
    for k = 1 to P-1
      // Complex dependencies
      A[i][j][k] = A[i-1][j][k] + A[i][j-1][k] + A[i][j][k-1]

      // Conditional computation
      if (i + j + k) % 2 == 0 then
        B[i][j][k] = A[i][j][k] * 2
      else
        B[i][j][k] = A[i][j][k] + 1
      endif

      // Cross-iteration dependency
      C[i][j][k] = B[i-1][j-1][k-1] + C[i][j][k]
    end for
  end for
end for
```

## Tasks
1. Model the iteration space using polyhedra
2. Analyze data dependencies using dependence polyhedra
3. Find legal loop transformations (interchange, skewing, tiling)
4. Optimize for parallelism and locality
5. Generate transformed code with improved performance

## Expected Output Format
- Polyhedral representation of iteration space
- Dependence analysis using polyhedra
- Legal transformation space identification
- Optimized loop nest with transformations applied
- Performance analysis of the transformed code
