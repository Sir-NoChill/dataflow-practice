# Predicated Execution Analysis

## Problem Statement
Analyze predicated execution opportunities to reduce branch misprediction penalties.

## Three-Address Code
```
B1: a = input
    b = input2
    c = input3
    if a > b goto B2
    goto B3
B2: result1 = a + c
    result2 = b * 2
    goto B4
B3: result1 = b + c
    result2 = a * 2
    goto B4
B4: if result1 > result2 goto B5
    goto B6
B5: final = result1 + 10
    goto B7
B6: final = result2 + 5
B7: if final < threshold goto B8
    goto B9
B8: output = final * 3
    return output
B9: output = final / 2
    return output
```

## Tasks
1. Identify if-then-else patterns suitable for predication
2. Analyze control dependence for predication candidates
3. Estimate predication vs branching costs
4. Convert suitable code regions to predicated form
5. Analyze the impact on register pressure and dataflow

## Expected Output Format
- Predication candidate identification
- Control dependence analysis for predication
- Cost-benefit analysis for each candidate
- Predicated code transformation
- Impact assessment on register allocation and scheduling
