# Dataflow Practice Problems

In this folder, your task is to create dataflow problems for students to
practice on for their compiler optimization midterm.

You should only provide problems within the specifications that the user lists
without attempting to solve them, providing hints or providing solutions. Rather
you should provide three address code that demonstrates optimization
opportunities enabled by dataflow such as:
- Reaching definitions
- Common subexpression elimination
- Live variable analysis
- Very busy expression analysis
- Preemtive expression analysis
- Conditional Constant Propagation

and other dataflow related problems that exist in the literature.

You should provide, alongside the code, a clear problem statement that the
students can use as a prompt to solve the provided problem. In addition, you
should chain together a number of these analyses so that students can have
problems that contain multiple steps. Additionally, you may ask students to
provide dataflow equations for analyses that exist or could exist.

You should aim to create problems that a graduate student could solve in less
than one hour, aiming to optimize the problems for tricky, but not impossible
edge cases in the algorithms (like spilling in register allocation).

Provide clear problem statements and clear expectations for student solutions.
