# Problem 50: Comprehensive Dataflow Framework Comparison (Difficulty: d5)

## Problem Statement

Compare and contrast different dataflow analysis frameworks on the same program:

```c
int comprehensive_example(int n) {
    int x = 10;
    int y = x + 5;
    int z = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int temp = x + y;    // potential CSE
        z = z + temp;

        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            x = x + 1;       // modifies x
        } else {
            y = y + temp;    // modifies y
        }
    }

    int result = x + y + z;
    int unused = x * y;      // dead code
    return result;
}
```

## Tasks

1. **Apply FIVE different analyses** to this code:
   - Reaching definitions
   - Live variable analysis
   - Available expressions
   - Very busy expressions
   - Conditional constant propagation

2. **Compare the frameworks** in terms of:
   - Complexity of implementation
   - Convergence properties
   - Information precision
   - Optimization opportunities enabled

3. **Analyze interactions** between the analyses:
   - Which analyses complement each other?
   - What is the optimal order of application?
   - How do they enable different optimizations?

4. **Design an integrated optimization strategy** that uses results from all analyses.

5. **Evaluate trade-offs** between analysis precision and compilation time.

## Expected Output Format

- Complete analysis results for all five frameworks
- Detailed comparison matrix
- Integrated optimization strategy
- Trade-off analysis and recommendations
- Discussion of when each analysis is most valuable
