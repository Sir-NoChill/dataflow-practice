# Problem 47: Constant Folding and Algebraic Simplification (Difficulty: d2)

## Problem Statement

Apply constant folding and algebraic simplifications:

```
B1:  a = 5 + 3              // fold to 8
     b = a * 1              // simplify to a
     c = b + 0              // simplify to b
     d = c * 0              // fold to 0
     goto B2

B2:  e = a - a             // fold to 0
     f = b / 1             // simplify to b
     g = c * 2 + c         // simplify to c * 3
     h = d + anything       // simplify to anything
     return g + h
```

## Tasks

1. **Define constant folding rules** for arithmetic operations.

2. **Apply algebraic simplifications** (identity laws, zero laws, etc.).

3. **Show the step-by-step simplification** process.

## Expected Output Format

- Constant folding results
- Algebraic simplification steps
- Final simplified code
