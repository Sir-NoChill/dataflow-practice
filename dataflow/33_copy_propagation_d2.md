# Problem 33: Copy Propagation Analysis (Difficulty: d2)

## Problem Statement

Perform copy propagation analysis on the following TAC:

```
B1:  a = 10
     b = a        // copy: b copies a
     c = b + 5    // can use a instead of b?
     goto B2

B2:  if c > 15 goto B3 else goto B4

B3:  d = b       // copy: d copies b (which copies a)
     e = d * 2    // can use a instead of d?
     goto B5

B4:  b = 20      // kills the copy b = a
     f = b + 1    // must use b, not a
     goto B5

B5:  g = b + c   // which value of b is used?
     h = a + g    // a is still available
     return h
```

## Tasks

1. **Define copy propagation analysis framework** by specifying:
   - The domain of the analysis (copy relationships)
   - The direction of the analysis
   - The generalized transfer function
   - The boundary value
   - The meet operator
   - The dataflow equation
   - The initialization of nodes

2. **Apply copy propagation analysis** to track which copy relationships hold at each program point.

3. **Identify optimization opportunities**:
   - Which uses of copied variables can be replaced with their original?
   - Which copy assignments can be eliminated?

4. **Show the optimized code** after applying copy propagation.

5. **Interaction with other analyses**: How does copy propagation interact with:
   - Dead code elimination
   - Constant propagation

## Expected Output Format

- Copy propagation framework definition
- Analysis results showing copy relationships
- Optimized code with copy propagation applied
- Discussion of interaction with other optimizations
