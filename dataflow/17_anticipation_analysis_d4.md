# Problem 17: Anticipation Analysis for Partial Redundancy Elimination (Difficulty: d4)

## Problem Statement

Apply anticipation analysis as part of a partial redundancy elimination optimization:

```
B1:  x = input1()
     y = input2()
     goto B2

B2:  if x > 0 goto B3 else goto B7

B3:  a = x + y
     if a > 10 goto B4 else goto B5

B4:  b = x * y
     c = a + b
     goto B6

B5:  d = x + y  // redundant with a?
     e = x * y
     f = d + e
     goto B6

B6:  g = x + y  // partially redundant
     h = x * y  // partially redundant
     goto B7

B7:  if x < 0 goto B8 else goto B9

B8:  i = x + y
     j = i * 2
     goto B10

B9:  k = x * y
     l = k + 1
     goto B10

B10: result = x + y + x * y
     return result
```

## Tasks

1. **Define anticipation analysis framework** for partial redundancy elimination.

2. **Apply anticipation analysis** to identify which expressions are anticipated at each program point.

3. **Combine with availability**: How would you combine anticipation analysis with available expressions analysis to identify partial redundancies?

4. **Design the optimization**:
   - Where should expressions be inserted to eliminate partial redundancy?
   - Which existing expressions can be eliminated?
   - Show the optimized code after partial redundancy elimination.

5. **Verify correctness**: Ensure that your optimization preserves program semantics and doesn't introduce unnecessary computations.

## Expected Output Format

- Complete anticipation analysis
- Discussion of combination with availability analysis
- Step-by-step partial redundancy elimination transformation
- Verification that the optimization is semantics-preserving
