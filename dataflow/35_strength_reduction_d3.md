# Problem 35: Strength Reduction Analysis (Difficulty: d3)

## Problem Statement

Apply strength reduction to optimize expensive operations in loops:

```
B1:  i = 0
     goto B2

B2:  if i < 100 goto B3 else goto B6

B3:  a = i * 4        // multiply by constant
     b = i * i        // square operation
     c = i * 7 + 3    // linear function
     arr[a] = b + c
     i = i + 1
     goto B2

B4:  // second loop with more complex patterns
     j = 1
     goto B5

B5:  if j < 50 goto B6 else goto B7

B6:  d = j * j * j    // cubic operation
     e = j * 5        // linear
     f = power(j, 4)  // fourth power
     result = d + e + f
     j = j + 1
     goto B5

B7:  return result
```

## Tasks

1. **Define strength reduction framework**:
   - What constitutes a "strong" vs. "weak" operation?
   - How do you identify induction variables?
   - What are the safety conditions for strength reduction?

2. **Identify induction variables** and their relationships:
   - Basic induction variables (loop counters)
   - Derived induction variables (functions of basic ones)

3. **Apply strength reduction transformations**:
   - Replace multiplications with additions where possible
   - Transform polynomial expressions
   - Optimize power operations

4. **Show the optimized code** with strength reduction applied.

5. **Analyze the performance gain**: Estimate the improvement in operation count.

## Expected Output Format

- Induction variable identification
- Strength reduction opportunities analysis
- Step-by-step transformation
- Performance improvement estimation
