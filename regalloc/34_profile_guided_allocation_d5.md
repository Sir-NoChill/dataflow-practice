# Problem 34: Profile-Guided Register Allocation

## Problem Statement
Use execution profile information to guide register allocation decisions for better performance.

## Three Address Code with Profile Data
```
1:  x = input              // executed 1000 times
2:  if x > 50 goto 5       // branch taken 300 times
3:  y = x * 2              // executed 700 times
4:  goto 6                 // executed 700 times
5:  y = x + 10             // executed 300 times
6:  z = y * y              // executed 1000 times
7:  if z > 100 goto 10     // branch taken 800 times
8:  result = z + 1         // executed 200 times
9:  goto 11                // executed 200 times
10: result = z - 1         // executed 800 times
11: return result          // executed 1000 times
```

## Task
1. Use profile data to weight basic blocks by execution frequency
2. Apply profile-guided spill cost calculation (prefer spilling in cold code)
3. Use profile data to guide coalescing decisions
4. Compare allocation decisions with and without profile guidance
5. Estimate performance improvement from profile-guided allocation

## Expected Output Format
- Profile data analysis and basic block weighting
- Profile-guided spill cost calculation
- Allocation decisions with profile influence
- Comparison with profile-unaware allocation
- Performance improvement estimation
