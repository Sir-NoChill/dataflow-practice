# Problem 42: Register File Partitioning Strategies

## Problem Statement
Explore different strategies for partitioning a large register file among competing allocation demands.

## Three Address Code (mixed workload)
```
// Computation-intensive section
1:  a = load array1[i]
2:  b = load array2[i]
3:  c = a * a
4:  d = b * b
5:  e = c + d
6:  temp_result = sqrt(e)

// Call-intensive section
7:  param1 = temp_result
8:  param2 = process_data(param1)    // frequent function calls
9:  param3 = another_call(param2)
10: param4 = third_call(param3)

// Memory-intensive section
11: store param4, output[i]
12: prefetch array1[i+1]
13: prefetch array2[i+1]
14: i = i + 1
15: if i < n goto 1
```

## Available Resources
- 16 total registers
- Need to partition between different code sections and calling conventions

## Task
1. Analyze register pressure patterns in each code section
2. Design partitioning strategies:
   - Static partitioning (fixed allocation per section)
   - Dynamic partitioning (adaptive to current pressure)
   - Priority-based partitioning (favor critical sections)
3. Apply each strategy and compare results
4. Consider calling convention constraints in partitioning decisions
5. Recommend optimal partitioning for this workload

## Expected Output Format
- Register pressure analysis per code section
- Design of each partitioning strategy
- Allocation results for each strategy
- Performance trade-off analysis
- Optimal partitioning recommendation
