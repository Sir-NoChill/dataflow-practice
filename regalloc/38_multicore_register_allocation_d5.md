# Problem 38: Register Allocation for Parallel/SIMD Code

## Problem Statement
Handle register allocation for code with parallel execution patterns and SIMD operations.

## Three Address Code (with parallel sections)
```
1:  n = 1000
2:  parallel_begin:
3:    thread_id = get_thread_id()
4:    start = thread_id * (n / 4)
5:    end = start + (n / 4)
6:    local_sum = 0
7:    for i = start to end:
8:      local_sum += array[i]
9:    end for
10:   // synchronization point
11:   barrier()
12:   global_sum += local_sum    // atomic operation
13: parallel_end:
14: return global_sum
```

## Task
1. Identify variables that are private vs shared across parallel sections
2. Handle register allocation for thread-private variables
3. Consider register constraints for synchronization operations
4. Optimize register usage for SIMD operations within the loop
5. Address register allocation challenges in parallel contexts

## Expected Output Format
- Analysis of variable scope (private/shared) in parallel sections
- Register allocation strategy for thread-private variables
- Handling of synchronization and atomic operation constraints
- SIMD optimization considerations
- Performance analysis for parallel execution
