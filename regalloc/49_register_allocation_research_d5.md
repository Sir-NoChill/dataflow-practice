# Problem 49: Cutting-Edge Register Allocation Research

## Problem Statement
Explore and analyze a novel register allocation problem that pushes the boundaries of current techniques.

## Scenario: Machine Learning Accelerator Code
```
// Neural network layer computation with specialized ML hardware
1:  input_tensor = load_tensor(input_data, shape=[1024, 512])
2:  weight_matrix = load_tensor(weights, shape=[512, 256])
3:  bias_vector = load_tensor(biases, shape=[256])

// Specialized hardware operations
4:  partial_sums = matrix_multiply_accumulate(input_tensor, weight_matrix)  // uses tensor registers
5:  intermediate = broadcast_add(partial_sums, bias_vector)                // uses vector registers
6:  activated = relu_activation(intermediate)                              // in-place operation

// Control flow with tensor operations
7:  if training_mode goto 10
8:  output = quantize(activated, scale, zero_point)                        // uses special quantization units
9:  goto 14
10: gradient_input = compute_gradients(activated, target)                  // uses gradient computation units
11: weight_gradients = backprop_weights(gradient_input, input_tensor)
12: bias_gradients = reduce_sum(gradient_input, axis=0)
13: output = apply_gradients(weight_matrix, bias_vector, weight_gradients, bias_gradients)

14: store_tensor(output, output_data)
15: return
```

## Novel Constraints
- Tensor registers (T1-T4): 1024x512 elements each
- Vector registers (V1-V8): 256 elements each
- Scalar registers (S1-S16): single values
- Specialized execution units with register affinity
- Memory hierarchy: L1 tensor cache, L2 vector cache, L3 scalar cache
- Power constraints: tensor operations consume 10x power

## Task
