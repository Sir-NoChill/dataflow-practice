# Problem 44: Register Windowing and Allocation

## Problem Statement
Handle register allocation with a register windowing architecture (like SPARC register windows).

## Three Address Code (multiple function levels)
```
// Level 0 function
1:  local0 = 100
2:  local1 = 200
3:  out0 = local0 + local1    // becomes in0 for called function
4:  out1 = local1 * 2         // becomes in1 for called function
5:  call level1_function
6:  result = in0              // return value from called function
7:  return result

// Level 1 function (new register window)
8:  param0 = in0              // from caller's out0
9:  param1 = in1              // from caller's out1
10: local2 = param0 + 10
11: local3 = param1 - 5
12: out0 = local2 + local3    // return value
13: return
```

## Register Window Architecture
- Each window has: 8 in registers, 8 local registers, 8 out registers
- Adjacent windows share in/out registers
- Window overflow/underflow handling required

## Task
1. Map variables to appropriate register window sections (in/local/out)
2. Handle register allocation within window constraints
3. Optimize cross-window register usage to minimize spills
4. Consider window overflow scenarios and spill strategies
5. Analyze the benefits and costs of register windowing

## Expected Output Format
- Variable mapping to register window sections
- Register allocation within windowing constraints
- Cross-window optimization analysis
- Window overflow handling strategy
- Performance analysis of windowing vs conventional allocation
