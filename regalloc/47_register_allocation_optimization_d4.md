# Problem 47: Advanced Register Allocation Optimization Techniques

## Problem Statement
Apply advanced optimization techniques to improve register allocation beyond basic graph coloring and linear scan.

## Three Address Code
```
1:  a = input_array[0]
2:  b = input_array[1]
3:  c = expensive_function(a, b)    // high-latency operation
4:  d = a + b                       // could be computed earlier
5:  if condition goto 8
6:  e = c + d
7:  goto 9
8:  e = c - d
9:  f = another_expensive(e)        // high-latency operation
10: g = simple_operation(a, b)      // could be scheduled differently
11: result = f + g
12: return result
```

## Task
Apply these advanced optimization techniques:

1. **Rematerialization**: Identify values that are cheaper to recompute than spill
2. **Live Range Splitting**: Split variables at optimal points to reduce pressure
3. **Register Packing**: Pack short-lived variables into the same register
4. **Instruction Scheduling Integration**: Reorder instructions to improve register reuse
5. **Speculative Register Assignment**: Use profile data to make speculative decisions

For each technique:
- Show where it can be applied
- Demonstrate the optimization
- Analyze the performance impact

## Expected Output Format
- Application of each optimization technique
- Before/after comparison for each optimization
- Combined optimization strategy
- Performance analysis and trade-offs
- Recommendation for when to apply each technique
