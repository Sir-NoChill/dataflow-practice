# Problem 36: Parallel Copy Insertion and Resolution

## Problem Statement
Handle parallel copy insertion during phi elimination and resolve potential circular dependencies.

## Three Address Code (SSA Form before phi elimination)
```
1:  a1 = 10
2:  b1 = 20
3:  if condition goto 6
4:  a2 = a1 + 1
5:  goto 7
6:  b2 = b1 + 1
7:  a3 = φ(a2, a1)
8:  b3 = φ(b1, b2)
9:  c = a3 + b3
10: return c
```

## Given Register Assignment
- a1, a2, a3 → R1
- b1, b2, b3 → R2

## Task
1. Identify where parallel copies must be inserted for phi elimination
2. Show the parallel copy requirements at each join point
3. Detect any circular dependencies in the parallel copies
4. Apply copy resolution techniques (using temporary registers if needed)
5. Generate the final sequential copy instructions

## Expected Output Format
- Phi elimination requirements and parallel copy identification
- Circular dependency analysis
- Copy resolution algorithm application
- Final sequential copy instruction sequence
- Verification that the transformation preserves semantics
