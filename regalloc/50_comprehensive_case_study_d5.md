# Problem 50: Comprehensive Register Allocation Case Study

## Problem Statement
Conduct a complete register allocation analysis on a realistic code example that incorporates multiple challenging aspects covered in previous problems.

## Three Address Code: Image Processing Kernel
```
// Image convolution with 3x3 filter
1:  image_width = 1920
2:  image_height = 1080
3:  filter = load_3x3_filter()
4:
5:  for y = 1 to image_height-1:
6:    for x = 1 to image_width-1:
7:      // Load 3x3 neighborhood
8:      p00 = image[y-1][x-1]
9:      p01 = image[y-1][x]
10:     p02 = image[y-1][x+1]
11:     p10 = image[y][x-1]
12:     p11 = image[y][x]
13:     p12 = image[y][x+1]
14:     p20 = image[y+1][x-1]
15:     p21 = image[y+1][x]
16:     p22 = image[y+1][x+1]
17:
18:     // Convolution computation
19:     sum = 0
20:     sum += p00 * filter[0][0]
21:     sum += p01 * filter[0][1]
22:     sum += p02 * filter[0][2]
23:     sum += p10 * filter[1][0]
24:     sum += p11 * filter[1][1]
25:     sum += p12 * filter[1][2]
26:     sum += p20 * filter[2][0]
27:     sum += p21 * filter[2][1]
28:     sum += p22 * filter[2][2]
29:
30:     // Boundary checking and saturation
31:     if sum > 255 goto 33
32:     if sum < 0 goto 34
33:     result = 255; goto 35
34:     result = 0; goto 35
35:
36:     // Store result with potential vectorization
37:     output[y][x] = result
38:   end for
39:
40:   // Progress callback every 100 lines
41:   if y % 100 == 0 then
42:     call progress_callback(y, image_height)
43:   end if
44: end for
45:
46: return output
```

## Task
Apply comprehensive register allocation analysis including:

1. **Multi-level Analysis**:
   - Basic block level allocation within the inner loop
   - Loop-level allocation considering loop-carried variables
   - Function-level allocation including calling conventions

2. **Multiple Algorithm Comparison**:
   - Graph coloring with different heuristics
   - Linear scan with interval splitting
   - Profile-guided allocation using loop structure

3. **Advanced Optimizations**:
   - Register promotion for frequently accessed array elements
   - Coalescing opportunities between loop iterations
   - Instruction scheduling integration

4. **Architecture Considerations**:
   - Different register counts (4, 8, 16 registers)
   - Vector register utilization possibilities
   - Cache-aware register allocation

5. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Spill cost estimation for inner loop
   - Impact of different allocation strategies on loop performance
   - Memory hierarchy considerations

## Expected Output Format
- Complete analysis workflow from initial TAC to final allocation
- Comparison of multiple allocation strategies with quantitative results
- Identification of optimization opportunities and trade-offs
- Performance predictions for different allocation choices
- Comprehensive case study report suitable for publication or advanced coursework
